Specifically, $u$ is not defined on characteristic curves that do not intersect $x=0$, so we cannot determine what $u$ is for any $(x,t)$ such that $x>0.5t^2$. Lame.\n",

When we stick with an IC based on $t=0$, then in the $(x,t)$-plane we see that each characteristic curve intersects the $x$-axis (i.e., where $t=0$) exactly once and the IVP is said to be *well-posed* because solutions exist and are unique."

Picture in your mind how you slow up to a \"pile of cars\" on the highway and then, seemingly miraculously, you arrive at some magical point at the end of the congestion where you can speed up again even though you still see a mess of cars in your rear view mirror. What happened? Mathematics happened!\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is reasonable to assume that $v(u)=g(u)u$ has a single maximum at some $u^*$ (i.e., there is a density where the group velocity associated with this density defines the largest flux). Do a thought experiment to reason this. If there is a single car traveling on the highway, then no matter how fast it is traveling, there is still a small flux. If there are too many cars on the highway so that traffic is \"crawling\", then there is a small flux. But, if there is a \"goldilocks\" number of cars on the road where a reasonably fast speed can be maintained with a reasonable number of cars, then the flux is probably \"optimally maximized.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Notice that $b(u)>0$ as $u<u^*$, which means that the phase velocity is positive so $x = x_0 + b(u)t$ is an increasing function, i.e., as time increases, the density of cars is moving forward in terms of transporting the density of cars in positive miles traveled.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - On the other hand, $b(u)<0$ if $u>u^*$, in which case $x=x_0 + b(u)t$ is *decreasing*, i.e., as time increases, the density of cars is failing to \"move forward\" and the congestion is increasing by backing up the density of cars. This is what happens with a growing traffic jam.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Going back to the integral lines, they may intersect because of this change of direction of $b(u)$. This means that \"loose and faster\" moving congestion catches up with \"dense and slower\" congestion. When that happens, $u$ becomes discontinuous and the theory becomes complicated. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We can put a source term $c(x,t)$ to model how many cars enter or leave the highway using on-/off-ramps at various points in space and at various times (perhaps according to rush hour)."
