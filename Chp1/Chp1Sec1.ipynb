    "In general, we use numerical methods to solve PDEs. By \"solve\" we mean produce a numerical estimate to $u$ at some set of points discretizing the domain. We do this because in general we cannot produce closed-form solutions to PDEs and must rely on numerical methods. However, we want to be able to *test* code under conditions where we *know* what the solutions are to make sure that the code is producing reasonable approximations to these known solutions. If this is not the case, then we would certainly *not* trust the code to produce useful estimates of solutions in cases where we have no idea what the solution is!\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to what is commonly referred to as the ***method of manufactured solutions.***\n",

    "The idea is quite simple. We want to solve a problem of a particular type such as $-\\Delta u = f$ numerically. The \"data\" of the problem (here, the $f$) will change in each particular instance, and the \"solution\" of the problem (here, the $u$) and its numerical approximation will subsequently change as the data varies from instance to instance. To verify the code is working properly via the method of manufactured solutions, we *start* with a solution. This may strange, but it is quite intuitive. Pick a $u$, any $u$, and as long as it satisfies any constraints of the problem (e.g., boundary conditions), you can then plug it into the differential equation to figure out what $f$ would have produced such a $u$. Now, you know the data $f$ that should be \"fed\" into the code to check if it produces a numerical approximation to the $u$ that you manufactured. That is it. This is the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is easier said than done because the constraints of the problem (e.g., boundary and initial conditions) may seemingly force you to \"throw\" away the function $u$ you wanted to use. We will see how to deal with this in Chapter 2 by simply \"adjusting\" the $u$ (usually through the inclusion of a linear function to adjust its boundary values) to create a function that does serve as a manufactured solution.\n",
