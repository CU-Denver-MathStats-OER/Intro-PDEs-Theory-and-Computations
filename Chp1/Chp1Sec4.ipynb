    "\n",
    "- The definition is pointwise in the sense that an IVP may be stable for some choices of $u_0$ but not others. This is similar to how continuity of a function is defined. Continuity is a pointwise property for a function. A function may be continuous at one point but discontinuous at other points (e.g., consider the [Heaviside function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function) that is continuous at all but one point in its domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Even if an IVP is stable with respect to all ICs, this does not mean that the stability is uniform meaning that for a given choice of $T,\\epsilon>0$, the $\\delta>0$ we have to choose in a proof of stability is likely to depend upon the particular choice of $u_0$. A uniform stability would mean that a single $\\delta>0$ can work for all choices of $u_0$. \n",
    "  \n",
    "    This is very much like the difference between functions that are continuous (in a pointwise sense) compared to uniformly continuous. For example, $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x)=x^2$ is continuous but not uniformly continuous whereas $f(x)=x$ and $f(x)=\\sqrt{x}$ are both uniformly continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$. Of course, any continuous real-valued function restricted to a closed-bounded interval $[a,b]$ is uniformly continuous on $[a,b]$. The issues arise when asymptotic growth rates \"get out of hand\" (so to speak). Since the temporal domain of dynamical systems is often taken to be $[t_0,\\infty)$ for some initial time $t_0$, the asymptotics play a large role, which is why the rigorous mathematical definition of stability requires the solutions to stay close for all $t\\geq T$. \n",

We will explore this below.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- If we identify a set, $\\mathcal{S}\\subset\\mathbb{R}$, of ICs for which the IVP is stable for any IC in this set, then we will generally say that the IVP is stable with respect to perturbations in ICs chosen from $\\mathcal{S}$. "

    "1. **Zero Stability.** This just means that perturbations remain bounded in the limit as $\\Delta t\\to 0$. \n",

    "Thus, zero stability, at a conceptual level, is very much like the stability we have seen above in the context of exact solutions to an IVP. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is rather a weak form of stability. For instance, we can prove convergence of a zero-stable method but then easily come up with examples where the exact solution converges to zero while the numerical solution oscillates with increasing amplitudes. Below, we consider the test problem with negative $\\alpha$ and get bad numerical results unless we make the step size very small using the common Forward Euler method studied in the [previous notebook](Chp1Sec3.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Absolute (or Unconditional) Stability.** This is also called **A-stability** for short. This means that applying the numerical method to the test problem with $\\operatorname{Re}(\\alpha)<0$ gives numerical solutions with the correct numerical behavior (i.e., the solutions should tend towards zero). The problem here is that we can have absolutely stable methods that damp rapidly decaying components only slightly, and small time steps might have to be used causing unnecessary computational burden.\n",
